About nmf_emma
================
``nmf_emma`` is a python package for performing end-member mixing analysis using non-negative matrix factoriation. Specifically, this package concerns discerning end-member contributions to dissolved river constituents. The methods employed here follow closely those of Shaughnessy et al. (2021) Hydrology and Earth System Science, 25, 3397--3409.
